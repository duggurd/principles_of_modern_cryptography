# Principles of Modern Cryptography
#### White Paper

## Abstract
It is easy to take for granted all the processes that happen under the hood in order to ensure the security of data in transfer and in storage. Furthermore understanding it, is a headache in itself. The first goal of this paper is to cover the core principles of modern cryptography in a clear way such that anyone with a bit of programming experience can understand it. The paper starts by covering foundational concepts and parts of cryptography, and then building upon that kowledge for more complex sucjects later in the paper. The second goal is to simply shine a light on the field of cryptography as it is becoming more and more important in daily life across society. In addition, building an understanding of how "safe" doesn't nexessarily mean safe. And finally, lay the groundwork for my own journy in cryptography by building a thorough understanding of the field through the subjects outlined in this paper.

The scope of this paper covers cryptographic problems in modern cryptography, core principles of modern cryptography, different types of key-encryption and hash functions alongside blockchain technology from a cryptographic viewpoint.

## 1. Introduction
Wikipedia: "Cryptography, or cryptology is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversarial behavior."[^wiki_crypto] 

From the use of transposition ciphers in the classical age to the enigma machine of WW2 and, finally, to the  recent rise of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology [^btc_wp]. Cryptography is becoming an ever increasing part of society and will continue to do so. *In the future rise of quantum computing and the cryptographic problems that will arise alongside it.*[^wiki_crypto] [^quantum_crypto]

<!--Basics-->
## 2. Cryptographic problems
There are numerous things to consider when encrypting a message. These considerations are the problems of cryptography and lay the framework from which all cryptographic processes are built. 

Encryption not inherently secure. More complexity, means harder to break, but more intensive to decipher, but ALSO encrypt.

Manipulating data such that it is directly unreadable, but possible to decipher with the right set of instructions.

The problems consist of factors such as complexity of the encryption, complexity of decryption, security of the functions, 

### 2.x Increasing complexity
Considering a simple form of encryption "Ceasar's cipher" or simply shift cipher, which by todays standards is a really insecure form of encryption.
<!--Insert image and explanation of cipher--> 
This outlines the first problem. The security of the encrypted data increases proportionally with the complexity of the encryption function.
